# How to contribute
Welcome everyone contribute to this project. We don't limit your behavior (code struction, code style and so on) excepting one point that you must implement the papers in C/C++. Because I hope the project can be used in the industry directly and is compileable on any platform. You can implement the Paper without any code. You also can convert the paper with code but in any other language into C/C++. You can use any open source C/C++ libraries, such as GSL, OpenCV, Eigen.
