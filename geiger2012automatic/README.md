#Automatic camera and range sensor calibration using a single shot (**partial implementation**)

This program is aim to implement the chessboards detection algorithm introduced by this [paper](https://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=48bac0b01b22b24028a5e6110335d107&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn)


## **IMPORTANCE**
Not all of the paper is implemented, only the robust chessboards detector is cast to C++. Different from this [repo](https://github.com/onlyliucat/Multi-chessboard-Corner-extraction-detection-). We open all of the source code of our implementation.


## Build

We still use CMake to build this program. And you should install the following libraries:

* [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/)

You may also need CMake to compute this program.
